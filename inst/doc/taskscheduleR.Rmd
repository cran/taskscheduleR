Schedule R scripts/processes with the Windows task scheduler. This allows R users working on Windows to automate R processes on specific timepoints from R itself.

Basic usage
-----------

The package allows to 

* Get the list of scheduled tasks

* Remove a task

* Add a task

    + A task is basically a script with R code which is run through Rscript

    + You can schedule tasks 'ONCE', 'MONTHLY', 'WEEKLY', 'DAILY', 'HOURLY', 'MINUTE', 'ONLOGON', 'ONIDLE'

    + The task log contains the stdout & stderr of the Rscript which was run on that timepoint. This log can be found at the same folder as the R script

Example usage:

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(taskscheduleR)
myscript <- system.file("extdata", "helloworld.R", package = "taskscheduleR")

## run script once within 62 seconds
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscript", rscript = myscript, 
                     schedule = "ONCE", starttime = format(Sys.time() + 62, "%H:%M"))

## Run every day at the same time on 09:10, starting from tomorrow on
## Mark: change the format of startdate to your locale if needed (e.g. US: %m/%d/%Y)
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscriptdaily", rscript = myscript, 
                     schedule = "DAILY", starttime = "09:10", startdate = format(Sys.Date()+1, "%d/%m/%Y"))

## Run every week on Sunday at 09:10
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscript_sun", rscript = myscript, 
                     schedule = "WEEKLY", starttime = "09:10", days = 'SUN')

## Run every 5 minutes, starting from 10:40
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscript_5min", rscript = myscript,
                     schedule = "MINUTE", starttime = "10:40", modifier = 5)

## Run every minute, giving some command line arguments
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscript_withargs_a", rscript = myscript,
                     schedule = "MINUTE", rscript_args = "productxyz 20160101")
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscript_withargs_b", rscript = myscript,
                     schedule = "MINUTE", rscript_args = c("productabc", "20150101"))

## get a data.frame of all tasks
tasks <- taskscheduler_ls()
str(tasks)

## delete the tasks
taskscheduler_delete(taskname = "myfancyscript")
taskscheduler_delete(taskname = "myfancyscriptdaily")
taskscheduler_delete(taskname = "myfancyscript_sun")
taskscheduler_delete(taskname = "myfancyscript_5min")
taskscheduler_delete(taskname = "myfancyscript_withargs_a")
taskscheduler_delete(taskname = "myfancyscript_withargs_b")
```

When the task has run, you can look at the log which contains everything from stdout and stderr. The log file is located at the directory where the R script is located.

```{r}
## log file is at the place where the helloworld.R script was located
system.file("extdata", "helloworld.log", package = "taskscheduleR")
```


RStudio addin
-----------

If you work with RStudio as editor, you can also just use the RStudio addin. In recent versions of RStudio (0.99.893 or later), select Addins and next select 'Schedule R scripts on Windows'.
This will allow you to select a script to be scheduled at your specified timepoints. The script will be copied to the Rscript repo folder and will be launched from there each time.
